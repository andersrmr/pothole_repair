Found online examples of geocoding by street intersetion, one involving googlemaps API - yeay!

Noon

Excceeded my rquests quota at GoogleV3 geocoder before getting what I needed.  Before even debugging the code.  Trying to get API key to see if I can do more querying that way.

OK, I finally have mapped the first 500 potholes/rows in my Seattle dataset.

Adam gave me a tip that I can just submit my locations to batchgeo and it will plot them all for me.

I need to talk to Ben again about how to structure my repo properly so that I can commmit daily.

Also, for my API query limit problem, Ben suggested I might create multiple accounts, i.e., work in parallel with multiple keys


A few of the Installs from today:

https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Shapely

Midnight

I have code that plots potholes on Seattle neighborhood map and shows density using chloropleths.  Locations seem reasonably good.  I still don't have geocodes for all the potholes.  Also, I still don't know how to include a third "feature" on the plot, e.g., represent time to repair, say, by size of hexagons/bubble plot.

One pattern is clear so far: locations/density of potholes

Scale is going to be a problem.  Would have to zoom in to capture the length scale of a pothole.

Also, I appear to decline from 482 city points/potholes to plotting only 121 potholes

Plan for Tomorrow:

0. Study geopy examples on train.

1. Continue geo-coding pothole locations first thing.  Try to fill query quota for each 24 hr period.  Add geo-coded street address to df also so that I can maybe use it with zillow to get fine scale property value.  also need to geo-code some important locations, e.g., center of ea Seattle city neighborhood, Space Needle, Pike Place Market, center of City of Seattle

- Census data
- zillow research data
- scrape from zillow
1.create url based on a small box around each pothole location/geocode
2.Grab the html
3.Search for the home values within that bounding box, i.e., grab everything that looks like a property value

2. Clean Seattle data completely and save cleaning code (later, can create class)

3. Plot time series of time to repair potholes and quantity of potholes

4. Get socio-economic data per pothole, either from zillow or census or older city data.

- Reverse geocode to get street addresses.  This seems to have worked.
- 

5. Plot/overlay time to repair on maps

(Wed: Get other basic feature data, e.g., road condition/weather)

AM

Used reverse geocode to obtain actual street addresses "closest to each pothole".  Pickled new dataframe.

Need to remember to utilize my quota for today's geocodes.  Still should have about 2,000 queries left out of 2500.

PM

Starting new notebook to get socio-economic data from zillow.  Talked to Michael Hood about possible approaches.

div class = 'property-listing data'
  div class = 'property-info'
    dt class='zestimate' Foreclosure Est:
      $224K

Scraping was a disaster.  I couldn't get anything to work.  At end of day, Adam suggested how to get census data on property values at the level of a block group at factfinder.census.gov.  I can hopefully associate potholes with the block group they fall within.  May be problems with aligning projections and/or other problems.

Will suggested that I first look at how variable are the repair times by pothole location.  Depending on the variability, I may not need property values at the scale of an individual pothole.

Plan for Tomorrow:

Overall: Get all initial features ready by end of day to start with simplest model Thurs AM, e.g., street condition, socio-economics, distances,...

Blocker: Inability to geocode all my potholes due to API query limits

Blocker: Inability to get socio-economic data at level of individual pothole because of data unavailability and/or difficulty of scraping it.

For example, Beautifulsoup at Zillow doesn't work.

1. Figure out how to do bubble plot of geographical distribution of pothole repair times.

2. geolocate 1st 2,000 rows.

3. Add features of distances to major/central locations, e.g., Space Neeedle, centers of ea neighborhood district (I could do a visual estimate and get it off google maps), center of Seattle, downtown convention center.

4. Try to get data on pre-existing street condition, DoT

5. Back to Socio-economics

AM

(Almost) Figured out how to make the scatter plots.  I'm close enough that I think I can do it once I get the data ready.

PM

I've decided I'm going to go back to the cleaned data set and use today's request/query quota to geocode the first 1,000 points/potholes.  Then proceed with those points, work on features, including socio-economic data and distances, and try to be in position to model by tomorrow AM.

Due to error, only got first 757.

Due to another Series index error, it took a long while to get the first 757 geo-coded records.

Ben suggested NLP on the LOCATION column to see if it might be predictive. 

I also need to be sure to create a feature for the neighborhood the pothole is in.  This should not be difficult with the mapping code.

http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/27702/what-is-the-srid-of-census-gov-shapfiles

1. Traffic signal distances
2. City of Seattle Parks
3. Street Network Database, size of roads
4. From contour map I can get slope/elevation
5. Locations of Traffic circles

Late PM

I got the neighborhood membership and several distance features working.

Also a "seasonality" category (actually, quarter of yr) and months till end of FY (assuming June.)

Can't figure out how to scale up map bubbles by a constant factor.  I just want them bigger. (http://glowingpython.blogspot.com/2011/11/how-to-make-bubble-charts-with.html)

17 Sept 2015

Plan for Today

Meet with Ben to do git versioning set-up

Figure out how to expand my bubbles on bubble plot

Book some time with Giovanna to try to scrape zillow

Identify a way forward to get the rest of the data

Produce my initial models based on the features I have.

- LR, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted

Tomorrow

Get the socio-economic data somehow
